# Fraud-Detection-Project
My first Machine Learning project for Fraud Detection
About the Project
This is my **first Machine Learning project**. I built this system to learn how to detect fraudulent transactions using data analysis and modeling.

## Why I created this?
As a **beginner developer**, I am passionate about exploring how AI can solve real-world financial problems. This project is my first step into the world of Data Science and remote work.

## Key Features
* Data cleaning and exploration.
* Applying Machine Learning algorithms.
* Learning how to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Status: Learning & Growing
I am still a beginner, and I am continuously working to improve my code and logic. I welcome any feedback or advice from the community!
